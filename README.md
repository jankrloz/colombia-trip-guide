The `tripData` object has the following structure:

```javascript
const tripData = {
  lodgingSummary: [
    {
      city: "Cartagena",
      name: "Airbnb's Bolivar",
      // ... other lodging details
    },
    // ... other lodging entries
  ],
  days: [
    {
      day: 1,
      date: "Jueves, 10 de Octubre",
      title: "Llegada a Cartagena",
      // ... other day details
    },
    // ... other day entries
  ]
};
```
